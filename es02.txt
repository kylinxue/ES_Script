歌名：take me to your heart
歌手：Michael Learns To Rock
歌词:Hiding from the rain and snow,Trying to forget but I won’t let go,Looking at a crowded street,Listening to my own heart beat,So many people all around the world,Tell me where do I find someone like you girl,Take me to your heart take me to your soul,Give me your hand before I’m old,Show me what love is - haven’t got a clue,Show me that wonders can be true,They say nothing lasts forever,We’re only here today,Love is now or never,Bring me far away,Take me to your heart take me to your soul,Give me your hand and hold me,Show me what love is - be my guiding star,It’s easy take me to your heart,Standing on a mountain high,Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky,I should go and see some friends,But they don’t really comprehend,Don’t need too much talking without saying anything,All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing,Take me to your heart take me to your soul,Give me your hand before I’m old,Show me what love is - haven’t got a clue,Show me that wonders can be true,They say nothing lasts forever,We’re only here today,Love is now or never,Bring me far away,Take me to your heart take me to your soul,Give me your hand and hold me,Show me what love is - be my guiding star,It’s easy take me to your heart,Take me to your heart take me to your soul,Give me your hand and hold me,Show me what love isbe my guiding star,It’s easy take me to your heart



歌名：you are beautiful
歌手：James Blunt
歌词：My life is brilliant,My life is brilliant,My love is pure,I saw an angel.Of that I‘m sure.  ,She smiled at me on the subway.  ,She was with another man.  ,But I won‘t lose no sleep on that,Cause I‘ve got a plan,You‘re beautiful. You‘re beautiful,You‘re beautiful, it‘s true,I saw your face in a crowded place,And I don‘t know what to do,Cause I‘ll never be with you,Yeah, she caught my eye,As we walked on by,She could see from my face that I was,Fucking high,And I don‘t think that I‘ll see her again,But we shared a moment that will last till the end,You‘re beautiful. You‘re beautiful,You‘re beautiful, it‘s true,I saw your face in a crowded place ,And I don‘t know what to do,‘Cause I‘ll never be with you,La la la la, la la la la, la la la la  ,laaaaaa,You‘re beautiful. You‘re beautiful,You‘re beautiful, it‘s true,There must be an angel with a smile on her face ,When she thought up that I should be with you,But it‘s time to face the truth,I will never be with you
